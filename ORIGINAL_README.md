Automatic exchange-rate updates for all enabled currencies relative to your default currency in Paymenter.

## Installation

### Step 1: Copy Extension Files

### Step 3: Access Exchange Rates

1. In your Paymenter admin panel, go to **Configuration** → **Exchange Rates**
2. You'll see all currencies from your main Paymenter installation
3. Set one currency as **Default** (this will be your base currency with rate = 1.0)

## Usage

### Fetching Latest Exchange Rates

1. Go to **Configuration** → **Exchange Rates**
2. Click **"Fetch Latest Rates"** to get current exchange rates from the API
3. The system will automatically update rates for all your configured currencies
4. You can manually adjust rates if needed
5. Click **"Save Changes"** to save your modifications

### Setting Default Currency

1. In the Exchange Rates page, select the radio button next to your preferred default currency
2. Only one currency can be default at a time
3. The default currency will always have a rate of 1.0

### Applying Rates to Products

1. After fetching and saving exchange rates, click **"Apply to Products"**
2. This will update all product prices based on the current exchange rates
3. Products will be converted from their current currency to the default currency

## Adding New Currencies to Products

### Method 1: Through Paymenter Admin

1. Go to **Configuration** → **Currencies** in your Paymenter admin
2. Add your new currency (e.g., INR, EUR, etc.)
3. The Exchange Rates page will automatically show the new currency
4. Fetch latest rates to get the current exchange rate
5. Apply rates to products to update all product prices

### Method 2: Manual Database (Advanced)

If you need to add currencies manually:

```sql
-- Add currency to main Paymenter currencies table
INSERT INTO currencies (code, name, symbol, enabled) 
VALUES ('INR', 'Indian Rupee', '₹', 1);

-- The extension will automatically create exchange rate entry on next page load
```

## Command Line Usage

You can also update exchange rates via command line:

```bash
# Update all exchange rates
php artisan currency:update
```

## Configuration

### Default Settings
